Various costume wildcards for female Marvel comics superheros and villains. It includes some Easter Eggs. Costumes may not generate accurately according to the comics depending on SD version and Checkpoint. Some costume prompts have issues overriding a TI or face LORA. This was noted on Captain Marvel, both versions of The Wasp, and Black Widow specifically. Some characters such as Moon Girl would generate as underage and requried removing the superhero name from the prompt to prevent underage generations, even if the prompt included negative prompts and other protections. NSFW generations can happen even if steps are taken to prevent it in the prompt.

Do not use Versions 1 or 2 except at own risk, after reading the prompts, and taking appropriate steps with negative prompts or editing the files.

Version 3 works rather well, but 4 or so of the prompts present issues with posting images to CivitAI due to forbidden words.
Version 4 should remove those words and is in testing.

Version 1 - Generated from ChatGPT with the request "create a comprehensive list of female marvel superheroes with descriptions of their costumes suitable for a Stable Difussion prompt. put each on its own line and do not include numbering" refined by "don't be so descriptive" and "add villians". Edited in Microsoft Excel to remove periods and format for SD 1.5 then transfered to Notepad++
Version 2 - Generated from ChatGPT with the request "create a token list for stable diffusion of female marvel superheroes and villains with descriptions of their costumes, put each description on its own line and do not include numbering" refined multiple times to removed unwanted formatting, include villains, and missing heroes. Edited in Microsoft Excel to remove periods and format for SD 1.5 then transfered to Notepad++
Version 3 - Edited version of Version 2, removed real names of Agent 13, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, The Wasp (both versions), and Captain America (Sharon Carter version), to address issues with the checkpoint trained data overriding any TI face in the prompt. Also included 2 Easter Eggs.
Version 4 - Removed any instance of the words "dead" or "death" as well as "brother," "daughter," "father," and "family," from the prompts to prevent issues on CivitAI
Version 5 - Removed a missed instance of Pepper Potts from Rescue prompt, cleaned up the Agent 13 and Captain America prompts further
